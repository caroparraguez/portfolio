        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <p>Dog owners sometimes need help to care for and walk their dogs. We need to create a service to connect them with dog walkers. They book someone but someone else showed up. The Main focus is how we can help dog owners trust their dogs are safe.</p>
        <p>Also, some foreign students love to pet a dog or cat but can’t afford it, due to a lack of time and money. They find dog owners through Whatsapp groups, discord servers, and Rover.com to take care of their pets and make some out of it but, Sometimes they don’t get paid or paid enough for their services.</p>
        <h4>Solutions</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>The dog walker’s profile is detailed enough, info is displayed in an organized and easy way to perceive.</li>
        <li>Users can easily define and filter low-rated profiles to find trusted dog sitters/walkers.</li>
        <li>Furry has a quick audio/video chat feature for the interviewers that create transparency before actually leaving them with their pets.</li>
        <li>Quick QR-based payment technology without going through multiple steps of verification making a frictionless experience for both the users.</li>
        <li>Furry provides features like live tracking during the walk, verified accounts, different badges for completing specific jobs, testimonials, links to social profiles, video intros, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>User research</h4>
      <p>For user surveys, I used tools like Maze and also the Publicly available data, Analytics, and also one-to-one user interviews.</p>

        <h4>Empathy Mapping</h4>
        <p>After conducting qualitative research and engaging in discussions with multiple users, I categorized the ideas, problems, and risk factors that users expressed, while also considering their insights. Subsequently, I defined project goals from the perspectives of the business, owners, and walkers. I further documented additional notes to ensure comprehensive coverage of user insights in the respective section.</p>

    <div class="p-four">
        <h4>User Flow</h4>
        <p>Upon comprehending the problem statement for both personas, I developed a user flow to visualize the interaction between the users and the application, starting from the login process and progressing towards booking the walker.</p>

        <h4>Wireframes</h4>
        <p>So we have some strategy and flow which shows the user journey from point A to point B. Now it’s time to visualize the tasks, and features and organize those components in a way that helps the user accomplish their goal.</p>

        <h4>Design System</h4>
        <p>To bring consistency to our product design, enable cross-functional collaboration, and increase the speed and scalability of design - I created a Design System, which includes Typography, Colors Styles, Icons, Illustrations, components, etc.</p>

    <div class="p-seven">
        <h4>Visual Design</h4>
        <p>The core idea was to make woof sleek and simple, with no unnecessary buttons or extra flair. Just a streamlined interface that guides the users to their goals. woof bright and fun color palette gives it a casual look to make sure the platform looks modern and enjoyable.</p>
